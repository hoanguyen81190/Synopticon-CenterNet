3. Guide how to build:
   1. Download model from model zoo
   2. Go into DNv2, run make.sh to build
	1. Go into dcn_v2_cuda.c, change: 
		extern THCState *state;
			to
		THCState *state = at::globalContext().lazyInitCUDA(); 
   3. Turn off downloading model from internet by going into file pose_dla_dcn.py, set pretrained to False, line 485, get_pose_net
